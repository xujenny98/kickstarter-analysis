# Overview of project 
Louise would like to know how theater launch dates and fundraising goals impact campaign results. 
# Purpose
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to compare Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date and Goals in order to achieve the optimal fundraising result in the future.  
# Analysis and challenges 
Analysis of outcomes Based on Launch Date: A pivot table was constructed by selecting outcomes in columns and values, date created conversion in rows, and parent category and year in filter. Then I created a line chart to perform an analysis between the successful, failed, canceled theatre outcomes in different launch months.   
<br />The number of successful outcome and Failure outcome for the theater is the highest during the month of May.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: A table was constructed to demonstrate the number and percentage of outcomes (successful, failed and cancelled) according to different goal. I performed the analysis by comparing the percentage of successful, failed and canceled rate to different fundraising goals. 

<br />The successful rate and failure rate has an inverse relationship.  Sucess rate is the highest when the goal is less than $1000 and is the lowest when the goal is around $45,000 to $49,999.

# Challenges 
Challenges of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Possible challenges are selecting the right date in the pivot table
<br />Challenges of Outcomes Based on Goals: A possible challenge is to correctly use the countifs function and selecting the right column.  

# Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
<br /> -Success and failure rate by launch date are moving at the same direction.
<br /> -Theater outcome based on launch date has the highest successful rate and failure rate.

<br />What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
<br />Higher dollar goals do not adversely impact success rate. 

<br />What are some limitations of this dataset?
<br />We are not sure if we are using the right representative sample size since we don't know the population size.  

<br />What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
<br />Other possible tables to look are the successful, failure, canceled rate by different country, currency and staff pick.
