# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to compare Theater Outcomes VS Launch Date and Outcomes VS Goals
# Overview of project 
The company would like to know different theater launch dates and fundraising goals impact campaign results. Analyze the campaigns outcomes based on launch date and goals in order to achieve the optimal fundraising result in the future.  

# Analysis and challenges 
Analysis of outcomes Based on Launch Date: A pivot table was constructed by selecting outcomes in columns and values, date created conversion in rows, and parent category and year in filter.  Then I created a line chart to perform an analysis between the successful, failed, canceled theatre outcomes in different launch months. Possible challenge is selecting the right date in the pivot table.  

The number of successful outcome and Failure outcome for the theater is the highest during the month of May.
